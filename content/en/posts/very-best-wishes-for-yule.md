> "Very best wishes for Yule - J. R. R. Tolkien"
> â€• Tolkien to Richard Jeffery in Letter 347, (dated 17 December 1972)

How to start a blog on Tolkien's Legacy in a better way than quoting J.R.R. Tolkien, himself ! In this period of holidays and end of year, called Yule in Middle-Earth, I decided to start a blog to share the little I know if it helps, a small gift to Tolkien's work.

Just a few words [about me]({{< ref "/about" >}} "About Me"), I am a Table Top Role Player since the 80s, I have 3 children and a Wife, and I am a professional developer. Saying that, I said nothing important but combining all together and thanks to the lockdown, last year I started as a hobby a project (it's nearly the first anniversary of the [project](https://gitlab.com/herve.darritchon/foundryvtt-tor2e "Official code repository")) to integrate *"The One Ring"* (v1) for [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/ "Official Site").  
At first, it was the v1 of the TTRPG (now it is ended) then the v2 ([The One Ring TTRPG](https://freeleaguepublishing.com/en/games/the-one-ring/ "Official site from Fria Ligan")) after the Kickstarter.

After nearly one year of coding, chatting with the community, role-playing with friends, I think it's time to aggregate some of my experience somewhere. People often ask me the same questions about The One Ring or the System I have done for FVTT, so it will be the place to put all the answers, all the reflexions I have, ideas, ...

Please take a sit, get some drink and meet me elsewhere on this blog to talk of Tolkien, Middle-Earth or TTRPG ;)

I wish you all the very best for Yule !
