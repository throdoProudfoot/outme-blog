Developing a system for a TTRPG is sometimes complicated because you have to make some choice because there are as many opinions as there are people playing :) And sometimes, opinions are opposite. So I try to make the system the less opinionated to let people use it and play as they want, but there are some limits.

For this first post, I will show you some keyboard keys you can use to ease your life. I have made a short video to show you how to do it, **in the bottom of the video you will see the keyboard keys I use**.

## Navigating between input fields {#navigating-between-input-fields}

If you need to go from one input field to the next one, you can use the **tab** key as it is shown in the video below.

### Tip

***Use Tab Key to go to next field and Shit+Tab to the previous one.***

It is fairly simple and easy to use when you want to fill quickly the value of the input field. Please keep in mind, it is very valuable with the last tips of this post about [modifying numeric values]({{< relref "#modifying-numeric-input-fields">}} "Modifying numeric values") with arrow keys.

## Skill value modification {#skill-value-modification}

One of the most misunderstood feature of [Tor2e](https://gitlab.com/herve.darritchon/foundryvtt-tor2e), it's how to modify the skill values (common skills, combat proficiencies, ...). I think it is the majority of the question we had, it is about this feature !

> *- How the hell am I modifying the skill value in the sheet ?*  
> *- There is a bug, I can't change the value of my sheet !*  

Well in fact, bugs can happen, I had experienced a lot, I am sorry about that, but it is part of the job of coding ;) But there is no bug with the modification of the skill value :

### Tip

***You HAVE to use the Alt Key to add one (+1) to the skill value and as a contrary Shift + Alt Click to decrease one (-1) to the skill value.***

You can have a look at the video below to see an example of **"How to modify the skill values of a character sheet"**.

{{< youtube id="GQ88-2Yo-v0?start=20&end=33" autoplay="false" title="How to add one and decrease one from Skill">}}

### Why did you do that

It is quite simple, character sheet should not be modified by miss click or by error, so I needed to find a solution, this one seems to be the best for me and for my players. I should have made another decision ... but you know ... if it wasn't the case, I won't be here writing about that so ... It is made this way and I tried to do so all over the sheets. So if you want to toggle a state (weary, miserable), you have to do the same.

## Modifying numeric input fields {#modifying-numeric-input-fields}

Last tips of the post, but not the least, because I think the most unknown ! It is about modifying numeric value using **arrow keys** (**up** and **down**). For all numeric input field, you use up arrow to add 1 and down arrow to decrease 1 from the current value. It is very straight forward and very useful if you use it with the first tip about [navigating between input fields]({{< relref "#navigating-between-input-fields">}} "Navigating between input field").

### Tip

***Use Up key to add 1 and Down key to decrease 1.***

Please look at the video below to see an example of how to use that in the System.

### Cherry on the Cake

If you use the up and down key, you will notice that the value of the field is limited top and bottom with a value I have set up in the system. This way you won't fill the input field with a wrong value. It is very convenient and avoid to type wrong value.

Even if you type a wrong value (not an integer for example), there is a tick and a cross to tell you if the value is "ok" or not for the system.

## Conclusion {#skill-value-modification}

I wanted for a while to share with 3 these 3 tips, because one is the most misunderstood and one is the most unknown :) I hope it will help you !

Use these 3 tips to easy your life using the system and have more times to enjoy and roleplay.
